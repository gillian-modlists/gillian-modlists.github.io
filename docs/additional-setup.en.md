description: Additional setup for your GTA IV installation - after performing the optimization or the drag-and-drop archive

# Additional Setup
Whether you're here after using the [drag-and-drop archive](drag-and-drop-archive.md) or performing the [optimization](optimization.md), we still need to do some setup for the best experience.

## Launch Options
???+ note "How to set the Launch Options?"
    There are two ways to:
    
    1. For Complete Edition, go to the game's Properties menu in :material-steam:Steam and set them there;
    2. For retail versions, create a :material-file-cog:`commandline.txt` in the game folder and edit it.
???+ tip "Setup Utility"
     [Automatic setup utility](../optimization/#setup-utility) can be used to set up the launch options semi-automatically.

The only options you need to set are: `-norestrictions -nomemrestrict`. All options with values should have a space between the option and the value.

???+ warning "When using DXVK or drag-and-drop archive..."
    * Add `-windowed` to use borderless fullscreen for better stability. Make sure `BorderlessWindowed` is enabled in :material-file-cog:`ZolikaPatch.ini` or/and :material-file-cog:`GTAIV.EFLC.FusionFix.ini` for this to work.
    * Disable `Enable Shader Pre-caching` in `Settings` - `Downloads` on Steam.
    * If the game doesn't show the correct amount of VRAM in the graphics settings (e.g. 512MB), add `-availablevidmem` with the amount of video memory of your GPU with a `.0` after it - up to `3072.0`.
    * If the game doesn't allow you to use the correct resolution/refresh rate, add `-width`, `-height` and `-refreshrate` with your monitor's native values. If it still doesn't help, add `d3d9.forceAspectRatio = 16:9` to :material-file-cog:`dxvk.conf`.
    * You can also add `-managed` for better performance, but your game may crash more often, especially with the `-nomemrestrict` option.

???+ warning "When running on Linux..."
    Perform a [DLL override](https://cookieplmonster.github.io/setup-instructions/#proton-wine) to use either :fontawesome-solid-gears:`dinput8.dll` or :fontawesome-solid-gears:`xlive.dll`.

!!! danger "But other guides use more options!"
    ^^Don't use them^^. They might have helped back in 2009 when the average customer PC's couldn't really handle precaching and other stuff, but nowadays these options just make things worse or act as a pure placebo. Only add options if a [mod](extras/mods.md) says to add one.

??? abstract "Full list of launch options"
    You can use these options for tweaking, debugging and playing around. The list is taken from the [PCGW page](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV#Launch_options)

## Optimal Game Settings
![GTA IV Settings](assets/gta4settings.jpg){: style="height:25%;width:25%"; align=right}
!!! note ""
    These settings are optimal for most people. If your PC is weaker - feel free to lower them. If your PC is stronger - feel free to increase them, but don't blame me for the issues.

??? info "Console Settings"
    These settings were set on console versions of the game, and the game is most optimized for them. They are included for having a complete list.
| Setting | Optimal Setting | Console Setting | Description | 
| :-----: | :-------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Video Mode | Your native resolution(max option, usually) | 1280x720 on Xbox 360; 1152x640 on PlayStation 3 | This setting controls your monitor resolution or, if the `-windowed` launch option is set, the size of the game window. |
| Aspect Ratio | Auto | Auto | This setting controls the aspect ratio of the screen relative to the resolution of your monitor. |
| Texture Quality | High | Medium | This setting controls the resolution of all textures. |
| Reflection Resolution | Very High | Medium | This setting controls the resolution of reflections (excluding water reflections). |
| Water Quality | Medium | Medium | This setting controls the density and intensity of waves in the water and water samples, as well as the resolution of water reflections. Medium is recommended as it is less extreme and more realistic. [Shader Fixes](essential-modding/shader-fixes.md) allows you to keep the max (1024x1024) reflection resolution at lower options. |
| Shadow Quality | High | Medium | This setting controls the resolution and render distance of shadows. Medium and Low rely much more on static shadows than High. Very High consumes ~20 FPS. |
| Night Shadows | Medium or Very High | Off | This setting controls how many local lights (e.g. car headlights) can cast shadows. Each quality level adds 4 additional shadow maps. This setting does not affect the resolution of dynamic shadows. [FusionFix](essential-modding/fusionfix.md) allows you to enhance this by adding dynamic shadows to most objects. Both [FusionFix](essential-modding/fusionfix.md) and [Shader Fixes](essential-modding/shader-fixes.md) fix the artifacts caused by this option. |
| Texture Filter Quality | Anisotropic 16x | Tri-Linear | This setting controls the anisotropic filtering. |
| View Distance | Between 21 and 70 | 21 | This setting controls the main LOD render distance for things like buildings and vehicles. Also affects the render distance for props. Setting it above 70 is known to cause instability and artifacts, as well as a negative impact on framerate. |
| Detail Distance | Between 10 and 70 | 10 | This setting controls the secondary LOD render distance for props detail. Setting it above 70 can cause instability and artifacts. |
| Vehicle Density | Preference - preferably below 90 | 33 | This setting controls the traffic density. Setting it too high can make driving too much of a hassle, especially with the unstable traffic AI, which can occasionally create random blocks even on straight roads and bridges. |
| Definition | On | Off | ==Ignore this and see the next two options if you're using [FusionFix](essential-modding/fusionfix.md) and [Shader Fixes](essential-modding/shader-fixes.md).==<br>This setting controls depth of field and motion blur - however, it is also known to cause problems with blurred image on PC and effects that simply do not scale up in resolution - due to that, either keep this option On and lose the effects or install [FusionFix](essential-modding/fusionfix.md) and [Shader Fixes](essential-modding/shader-fixes.md) and see the next two options instead. Can be quickly toggled by pressing ++p++ button.</br> |
| Motion Blur | Off | Off | This setting toggles motion blur. At the time, Off and On options are reversed - this will be changed in future [Shader Fixes](essential-modding/shader-fixes.md) updates. Can be quickly toggled by pressing ++p++ button. ==Only appears when using [FusionFix](essential-modding/fusionfix.md). The change itself comes from [Shader Fixes](essential-modding/shader-fixes.md).== |
| Depth of Field | On | On | This setting controls depth of field. ==Only appears in `Settings` - `Display` when using [FusionFix](essential-modding/fusionfix.md).== |
| FXAA | On | On | This setting controls FXAA (a simple method of Anti-Aliasing). ==Only appears when using [FusionFix](essential-modding/fusionfix.md). The change itself comes from [Shader Fixes](essential-modding/shader-fixes.md).== |
| VSync | Off | On | This setting controls the vertical synchronization. ==We'll use the one bundled with [DXVK](optimization.md) instead, as it has much better framepacing.== |
| Console Gamma | On | On | [Changes the gamma to match the console-like look.](essential-modding/assets/console-gamma.png) ==Only appears in `Settings` - `Display` when using [FusionFix](essential-modding/fusionfix.md). The change itself comes from [Shader Fixes](essential-modding/shader-fixes.md).== |
| FPS Limiter | 60 | 30 | Changes the FPS limit. Recommended to set to 60 to avoid [timing issues](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV#Timing-related_issues). ==Only appears in `Settings` - `Display` when using [FusionFix](essential-modding/fusionfix.md).== |
| Screen Filter | Default | Default | Allows you to switch the timecyc file to match different screen filters (e.g. to have TBoGT filters in IV and vice versa). ==Only appears in `Settings` - `Display` when using [FusionFix](essential-modding/fusionfix.md).== |

??? question "What is :material-file-cog:`stream.ini`?"
    Other guides often use :material-file-cog:`stream.ini` and change the values in there from `2048000` to `4096000`. From [PCGW users' observations](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/w/index.php?title=Topic:X1jmh4mc3t6mv3hv&topic_showPostId=xb5gbd4mggke2ets#flow-post-xb5gbd4mggke2ets), as well as my own - this provides no benefit whatsoever and is probably a placebo.

You can stop here if all you wanted was to improve your performance, however I'd advise going up to install essential mods for best experience.
