Game definitely didn't get the best PC treatment, but thanks to Re:Fined we can have a very much enjoyable experience here. In many ways, even superior to the original one. Other than that, there's a bunch of HD mods, aswell as overhaul ones.

## Game Settings { data-search-exclude }
Game has a limited amount of settings - you only set up the screen/window mode, resolution, framerate lock, VSync, brightness and colorbrind options. Has hard-locked AA. See the [PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_HD_1.5_%2B_2.5_ReMIX#Ultra-widescreen) for ultrawide or square monitor setup.
!!! note "Anisotropic Filtering"
    The game uses 4x Anisotropic by default without any way to toggle it. If you don't like that, you can increase it to 8x/16x via Nvidia Control Panel or AMD Adrenalin.

## Mods { data-search-exclude }
You may need these tools:

- [OpenKH](../tools/#openkh-mod-manager) for most mods. You can use [KHPCPatchManager](https://github.com/AntonioDePau/KHPCPatchManager) instead for patching, but OpenKH will generally be better.
