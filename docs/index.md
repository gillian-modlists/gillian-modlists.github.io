# Introduction

Welcome to Gillian's Grand Theft Auto IV Modding Guide.

This is a centralized, all-in-one guide. It includes steps for [optimizing](optimization.md), [tweaking](additional-setup.md), [fixing, improving](essential-modding/index.md) the game, [experiencing multiplayer](multiplayer.md) and [more](extras/index.md)!

I am not the author of any of the following modifications, so any bugs/crashes/errors should be reported to the developers themselves. 

## Prerequisites
!!! warning ""
    - In order for this guide to be useful to you, please make sure that the following requirements are met:
        * A PC running Windows 10/11 or any up-to-date Linux distribution suited for gaming.
        * You **must** own the game on [:material-steam:Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/12210/) or the [Rockstar Games Launcher](https://store.rockstargames.com/game/buy-grand-theft-auto-iv). Pirated versions are not supported. Retail versions with 1.0.8.0 are not supported, but should work as long as you get rid of the DRM.
        * Your PC must at least meet the [minimum requirements of the game](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV#System_requirements "Requirements on PCGW - copied from Steam"). For a pleasant experience, however, it should also meet [DXVK's requirements](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/wiki/Driver-support "DXVK's GitHub Wiki") (ignore Linux requirements such as Wine if you're running Windows; older GPUs may meet the 1.10.3 requirements instead).
        * The game should not be located in :material-folder:`C:\Program Files` or :material-folder:`C:\Program Files (x86)` to avoid permission issues. ==This is irrelevant for :material-steam:Steam users.==
        * Make sure you have enough free space on your drive (the base game takes about 22GB, a backup will take just as much, plus count in all the modding you'd do - reserve at least 70GB counting the game too).
        * You need to have an archivator installed. I recommend [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/ "Official 7-Zip website").
        * Make sure you have the game's prerequisites installed (they're already taken care of by :material-steam:Steam and the Rockstar Games Launcher) - [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 **x86**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679 "Microsoft's official redistributables") and [DirectX End-User Runtimes (June 2010)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109 "Microsoft's official redistributables").

## Gameplay Demo
Your game will look and play roughly like this after finishing the modding (the [drag-and-drop archive](drag-and-drop-archive.md) has been used for these videos).

## Sections
If you have no need for the in-depth tutorials, you can simply install the [drag-and-drop archive](drag-and-drop-archive.md) and you are ready to go.

Otherwise, start with [optimization](optimization.md).
