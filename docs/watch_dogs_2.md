I don't think this game even has any mods. If it does, they're not notable. The state of the game on PC in general is really good, though.

## Game Settings { data-search-exclude }
- Get yourself a half-decent CPU and play on SSD, please. It's unbearable otherwise.
- Follow the [graphics guide](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/watch-dogs-2-graphics-and-performance-guide/) to get graphics settings that are good for your specific hardware.
