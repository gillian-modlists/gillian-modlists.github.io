Also known as: TES 5
## Links { data-search-exclude }
- [Store Page (Steam)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/)
- [Store Page (GOG)](https://af.gog.com/game/the_elder_scrolls_v_skyrim_special_edition)

The notoriously broken Bethesda release:material-trademark:. Thankfully, mods can fix this mess once again. Bless the PC modding community.

## Game Settings { data-search-exclude }
Use [Bethini Pie](../tools/#bethini-pie) for configuration - it has nice and optimized presets aswell as more options to configure your game.

## Tools { data-search-exclude }
- A mod manager. I use [Mod Organizer 2](../tools/#mod-organizer-2). You don't completely need one, though - you can stick with just [LOOT](https://loot.github.io/).
    * I do not provide installation instructions for most mods for one simple reason - you simply just press the "Install with mod manager" for most of them.

## Essentials { data-search-exclude }
!!! warning "About the 'Anniversary Edition' and 'Special Edition'"
    You may have noticed mods point them out as different things, and you can assume that the thing sold on Steam/GOG is reflecting that aswell. It does not. 
    
    The "Anniversary Edition" is the **latest** build of the game, you get it independently of which edition you bought. Also called as the `1.6` version of the game.
    
    The "Special Edition" is the **old** build of the game that is no longer supplied officially. You can [downgrade](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57618) it if some mod requires specifically the old Special Edition build. Otherwise, stick to the "Anniversary Edition" versions of the mods. Also called as the `1.5` version of the game.

!!! warning ""
    Remember to `Sort` the mods after installing them. Mod Organizer 2 uses LOOT to do it.

    ### [Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE)](https://skse.silverlock.org/) { data-search-exclude }
    You need this for most mods.
    ### Installation { data-search-exclude }
    - Go to the [website](https://skse.silverlock.org/).
    - Download the "Current Anniversary Edition build".
    - If not using a mod manager, just drop everything from the `skse64...` folder into the game folder. 
    - If you do, only drop in the `.exe`, `.dll` folders. In the mod manager, only install the `Data` folder.
