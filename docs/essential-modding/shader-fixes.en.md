## Installation { data-search-exclude }
You can either install this mod as a standalone, as a part of [UAL's modloader](../../extras/modloading/#ultimate-asi-loader) or update the files in [FusionFix](fusionfix.md) which already contains this mod.

!!! tip ""
    It is recommended that you install [FusionFix](fusionfix.md) instead, and only update its files as needed, as it has features that are complementary to Shadow Fixes.

??? tip "Restoring the vanilla noise look in TLAD"
    If you don't like the noise tiling in TLAD that Shader Fixes introduces to make it look like the console version, you can extract [this archive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zxCWhWQ4qP4rJvUablTGjfqpFUp3UOS3/view?usp=sharing) ontop to restore the vanilla look. The files are organized for the UAL's modloader, but you can repurpose the files manually.
