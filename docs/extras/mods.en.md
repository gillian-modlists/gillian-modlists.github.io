# Mods
The Grand Theft Auto series has a rich modding community that spans most GTA games, and GTA IV is no exception! This list contains all the vanilla-faithful mods I know of, but I won't list instructions on how to install them, as mods usually list their own instructions, so it becomes redundant.
!!! warning ""
    Be sure to back up your files before making any changes. Use a [modloader](modloading.md) to avoid file replacement - but this may not work for all mods.

    Most mods in the list are oriented towards 1.0.7.0 and 1.0.8.0.

    Avoid using larger-scale and select smaller-scale mods in [multiplayer](../multiplayer.md).

    I'm only listing these mods - I do not intend people to actually install all of them together. Pick what to install yourself.
