This is one of the fairly pleasant PC releases - in the technical state of things. I had a lot of personal gripes with the games of course, but the technical state was fairly good.

    ### [Radical Replicant](https://wiki.special-k.info/SpecialK/Custom/Replicant) { data-search-exclude }
    Or simply [Special K](../tools/#special-k) patches - you need to install it to use them. 
    
    !!! warning ""
        You need to [downgrade](https://wiki.special-k.info/SpecialK/Custom/Replicant#issues-with-the-latest-game-version-v103) to use these patches - but in personal experience you only need it if you need the specific fixes it provides. Game's playable otherwise.

    ### [Shader Improvements](https://www.nexusmods.com/nierreplicant/mods/16) { data-search-exclude }
    Gets rid of pseudo-TAA, blur when rolling, mitigates player hair/fur transparency dithering and adds bindable HUD Toggle and large minimap mode.

    !!! warning ""
        Minimap modes are toggled by the ++f1++ and ++f2++ keys, but that specific feature will not work if you installed Radical Replicant/Special K.
