It's a fairly decent game on the technical state of things. A bunch of issues from time to time, but nothing major from my experience. Oh, and yeah, the Definitive Edition thing is the same game, nothing changed LOL.

I also included Mafia DE onto this page because making a separate page for it just to mention one mod is stupid.

## Mods { data-search-exclude }
=== "Mafia III"
    * [Disable TAA Blur](https://www.nexusmods.com/mafia3/mods/94)
        * Mod also disables a bunch of other post-FX, but that's optional. This game has horrible TAA that's both blurry *and* ghosty. Though disabling it comes with other issues, see the page.
    * [DLC Cars in Traffic](https://www.nexusmods.com/mafia3/mods/107)
    * [No grinding](https://videogamemods.com/mafia/mods/nofuckinggrindmod)
        * Reduces the amount of grind you need to progress the game. Because seriously it gets annoying. 
        * You can also just use [these savefiles](https://gregor-pl.itch.io/mafia3onlymainmissions) to skip side stuff entirely - main story's the only good thing in this game anyway.
