The state of both the original and the Definitive Edition is... hard to describe. Personally, I'd tell you to avoid the Definitive Edition (you have to buy it to get the original anyway, though). There's a lot of bugs in the Definitive Edition, at least from the period I'm checking - some up-to-date sources claim some of it was fixed, but I wouldn't take their word for it. I didn't find the improvements worth it to gamble.

    A huge graphics overhaul mod. It's honestly pretty good, but I never managed to set it up myself. Feel free to try your luck at it, though, as I think it's very much worth it myself.
