    !!! warning ""
        This list is based on the latest version of FusionFix. If you're using the legacy or other outdated version, you may be missing some of these options.

        The options are either `0` for disabled and `1` for enabled unless otherwise noted.
    
    * `SkipIntro` allows to skip the game's normally unskippable intro video. This setting has an in-game toggle in Settings - Game. ==Default is `1`.==

    * `BorderlessWindowed` launches the game in Borderless Windowed mode instead of Exclusive Fullscreen, which the game uses by default (`-windowed` [launch option](../../additional-setup/#launch-options) must be set for this to work). This setting has an in-game toggle in Settings - Game. ==Default is `1`.==
    * `RecoilFix` enables weapon recoil on keyboard&mouse controls, which is only present on gamepads due to an oversight. ==Default is `1`.==
    * `DefinitonFix` fixes the behavior where the game ignores the Definition [setting](../../additional-setup/#optimal-game-settings) in cutscenes. ==Default is `1`.==
    * `EmissiveShaderFix` fixes broken emissive shaders present in the PC port. ==Default is `1`.==
    * `AimingZoomFix` fixes inverted zoom control in TBoGT and allows to remember last zoom multiplier. The options are `0` for disabled, `1` for an xbox-like fix, `2` to also enable the fix in IV and TLAD, `-1` to disable the feature. ==Default is `1`.==

    * `DynamicShadowForTrees` makes tree shadows dynamic. ==Default is `1`.==
    * `FpsLimitPreset` controls the FPS limiter preset. Toggle from the in-game Settings - Display tab instead - recommended to limit to 60 FPS to avoid [timing-related issues](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV#Timing-related_issues). ==Default is `0`.==
