description: Gillian's tools list and instructions to use them

# Tools { data-search-exclude }
This page lists all the tools separately away from my modlists. The reason for that is due to games sharing tools fairly often. However, don't use this page separately - other games link to the required sections already.

## Mod Managers { data-search-exclude }
### [OpenKH Mod Manager](https://github.com/OpenKH/OpenKh/releases) { data-search-exclude }
OpenKH offers a lot of modding tools for Kingdom Hearts, but the one you'd mainly want to use as a regular user is the Mod Manager, which allows to patch a good variety of mods aswell as set up their priority. Also has a modloader(Panacea) which reduces build time.

???+ note "Installation"
    - Go to the latest release of , download it and unpack in any desired folder (not the game folder directly).
    - Open :material-file:`OpenKh.Tools.ModsManager.exe`. Go through the instructions, install Panacea and unpack the desired game.
???+ tip "Usage"
    - To install mods, click `Mods` -> `Install a new mod...` (or press the plus to the right of the list) and from there either pick a downloaded mod or leave the name for a repository on GitHub.
    - Change priority as desired.
